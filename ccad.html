                <p>The CCAD website was a project that started out as a graphic design project and quickly turned into an interaction and information design project for me, while the rest of my team focused on the graphics. The large number of complaints about the site being “hard to use” lead me to take a closer look at the site than I initially would have in a simple re-skin, and I found that the three major problem areas were:  overwhelming menus, dense pages and lack of an information architecture that made much sense to the site’s core audiences.</p>

                <div class="span8">
                    <p>After multiple meetings with stake holders trying to reduce the number of menu options on the site, it became clear that there was just no way to remove many of them without negatively impacting one group or another. The consensus by the stakeholders was unattainable. This was a problem we needed to design a solution for.</p>
                <p>The 2-column “Smart-menu” is the solution I arrived at— a menu that could show a variety of options in a smaller amount of space. In the left column, all the sections for a specific audience are displayed, with the top option selected by default. In the right column, a sub-menu with all the topics in the selected section. This allows a large number of menu items to displayed in a menu no taller than the screen.</p>

                <p>One of the biggest challenges of the site was redesigning the information architecture. After looking at all the information on the site and talking to the various stake holders, we decided to organize the site by Audience. The top menu is dedicated to switching between audience specific sections of the site: Future Students, Current Students, Alumni, Employees, and Educators. Each page of the site was then analyzed and broken out into easily digestible pieces and placed in the section that made the most sense for the content. Section landing pages were added to the site to give a brief overview of the content in a section and make browsing the site easier. Because adding a CMS was deemed too expensive a change to make in this redesign, compartmentalizing the pages into smaller, logical groups made maintenance easier than having to manage the larger pages of the old site, even though there were more files</p>

                    <p>Although my time at the CCAD Design Group ended before this site design could be fully implemented (it was built and deployed approximately 4 months after my departure) testing of prototypes showed across all audiences considerably faster access to the information users were looking for, and much less frustration from not being able to find something, or from running into something that appeared broken (such as a menu that dropped down below the fold). Additionally, the members of the web team in charge of maintaining the site found the new design much easier to maintain.</p>
