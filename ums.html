                <p>Ultimate Money Skills is a joint venture between Monster.com’s Making it Count and Bank of America. This redesign was an attempt to drive more repeat traffic to the site and after an initial evaluation it was clear that there was little incentive to motivate repeat use. The site was essentially a collection of articles, organized by topics but our research showed that most of our target users were looking for specific task based information, not broad topics. The topic headings didn’t help them find what they were looking for because they weren’t sure where to look. The articles were also not updated frequently enough to generate many repeat visits.</p>

                <div class="span8">
                    <p>Because we had to keep the existing topic based hierarchy in place, I designed a “smart menu” to provide quick links to users in there own language. This menu was characterized as “the knowledge bank” and it was a character that presented topics to the user as questions they might be asking, such as “I’m getting a loan, what do I need to know?” This more human friendly navigation tested very well, and the users felt it was much easier than finding what they wanted from a list of articles in the “loans” section. To help the traditional navigation we also renamed some of the labels to be more user oriented.</p>

                <div class="span8">
                <p>We proposed adding a social aspect to the site as well. The site was already managing account information, mostly for marketing purposes, so the additional attempts to build a community around those accounts seemed like a no brainer. Allowing users to create a profile page, and share articles, comments and quiz results would give them a reason to return to the site, to interact with the community and view user generated content that was updated more frequently than the Making It Count generated content. Unfortunately the social aspect of the site was not approved, and the site was built without it.</p>

                    <p>On it’s initial launch, we saw the new navigation scheme brought views of all individual articles up, likely due to the fact that users could easily find them. Repeat traffic however stayed flat in the first month of the site’s relaunch.</p>
