            Hi there. You're probably expecting to see somethign that didn't look like it came from Geocities circa 1996 (the best year of the early web, fwiw.) Turns out my Wordpress site didn't survive the migration to the new web host, and while I hack something better together, we're all stuck with this beauty I made using the awesome <a href="http://code.divshot.com/geo-bootstrap/">Geo for bootstrap theme</a>...because when else will I have an excuse to use it? Brand new, serious business site coming soon. For now enjoy the retro flava
