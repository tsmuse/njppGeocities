                <p>When I came to Monster.com in 2008 one of the big agenda items for the Making it Count business unit was a redesign of their website to make it “not feel like it’s from 1996.” This project had been a low priority for the marketing department before I was brought on, and remained a low priority during my time with the company. Although extensive work was done in multiple rounds of wireframes, and flats to try and get a feel for what the site needed to become, it was apparent to me after a few days looking at the site that more was needed than just a visual refresh. The site needed to be redesigned from the ground up.</p>

                    <p>Making it Count is one of many educational units inside Monster Worldwide. The unit’s primary operations consisted of writing and performing in-school presentations for high school freshman, juniors, and seniors and college freshman on a variety of topics from “how to make the most of your four years in high school” to “how to be smart with your money.” In support of these in-school presentations, makingitcount.com provided students, parents and educators with articles, written by the Making it Count staff, to enrich the in-school experience before and after a presentation was given. The website, and all the content of both the website and the in-school presentations were vetted by the company’s Educator Advisory Board and Student Advisory Board. These were groups of selected educators (primarily guidance councilors) and students from participat- ing schools and they acted as focus groups for most of the materials the company produced, including makingitcount.com.</p>
                    <p>The primary business goal of the site was to sell advertising against. Part of the partnership deals the company brokered as it’s primary source of income included banner advertising on Making it Count’s websites. To this end, total impressions and return visitors were the most important metrics to improve with a redesign.</p>

                <p>When I arrived, the site was very reminiscent of a site from the early days of the internet. Optimized for an 800×600 screen resolution, using the web-safe color pallet, and animated GIFs, the site felt dated, even though new content was being added to it weekly. Most of the staff commented only on the visual appearance of the site though, and while I was there neither focus group was asked about the usability of the site, or what they would like to see from a new and improved makingitcount.com. I however, saw deeper problems with the site, and set out to change them in my iterations on a redesign. The major issues of the site were: </p>
                   <ul>
                       <li>Registration/login wall on all content</li>
                       <li>Content was organized into 3 very long lists on the student, parents and educators pages</li>
                       <li>The newest content was not differentiated from older content in anyway, thus difficult to find for returning users.</li>
                       <li>The blogs on the site only had participation from spammers, and had very low page views.</li>
                       <li>Flow experience was almost impossible due to constant interruptions of content.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>A Paradign Shift</h4>
                    <p>Spending a few days really using the site, reading the articles and searching for information as if I was a student, parent or educator, the main flaw of the site quickly began to emerge. It was organized in a way that was far from intuitive. After a short time thinking about a new organization scheme, a familiar one came to mind and fit. The content would easily fit into the paradigm of a magazine— lots of content separated into departments to tailor to a broad audience, with weekly features for content that was deemed important to all audiences. With this new paradigm in mind, I set off wireframing the site. The attached wireframes are the last revision I produced.</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately because of this projects low priority, the last set of wireframes were never approved. Management was not convinced that reorganizing the site to mimic a magazine or similar publication was appropriate for the content or cost effective, as it required rebuilding the site from scratch. At the time I left Monster, the designs still hadn’t been submitted to the senior management team for formal review and approval. However, I fully believe this new design to be the appropriate direction to move the content in, giving users easier access to the content as well as features that change frequently enough to drive return traffic.</p>
                   <h4>Proposed home page:</h4>
                    <p>Taking full advantage of an average screen resolution of 1024×768, the new homepage uses this space to show almost six times as much information as the old home page. The addition of featured articles, search and simple navigation lets the web site get out of the way of the information it is there to convey. “The Buzz” and “What’s the What” were new top five lists for the most read and most voted on articles on the site.</p>
                    <h4>Proposed home page: log-in</h4>
                    <p>The original site took the user to a separate log-in page when they clicked on the log-in link anywhere on the site. By utilizing modal windows, the user can log-in to their account anywhere on the site without loosing their place. This uninterrupted log-in model allows for a better reading experience.</p>
                    <h4>Proposed section page:</h4>
                    <p>Organized much like the homepage, but longer and potentially spanning several pages, the section page exists for each of the three sections of the site: Students, Parents, Educators. Each section already had some existing reoccurring series, this layout places the options to filter only those series at the top.</p>
                    <h4>Proposed article page:</h4>
                    <p>Articles inside a section always retain their section’s navigation. In the new layout, articles have an image as well as the ability to share, comment (talk) and promote (vote). These three social functions directly affect The Buzz and What’s the What across the site. Additionally, these actions are recorded in the user’s profile page.</p>
                    <h4>Proposed user profile page:</h4>
                    <p>In the existing site, a user account only allowed you to bypass the log-in wall. Since this design proposes to re-move the log-in wall, we need to give users a better reason to log in. Creating a profile that allows them to have authority and a fixed place in the discussions that will happen in the comment section acts as that incentive.</p>
                    <h4>Proposed programs page:</h4>
                    <p>Borrowing from the editorial feel of the rest of the site, each program is listed as a featured article. The links at the top of the page go directly to each program page. Individual programs can be voted and commented on just like articles in the other sections of the site. This decision made sense with the way the rest of the site worked, and allowed for reuse of another template for content that saw very little traffic.</p>
