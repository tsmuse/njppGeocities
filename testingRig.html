                <p>I was approached by Dr. Evans and Psychster in the spring of 2011 to design a tool that would allow Psychster to enhance it’s mobile usability testing practice. There were a number of solutions to this problem already, but none of them let Psychster’s analysts test a piece of usability software in a realistic way, all the existing camera rigs and slates interfered with the natural hand position of the phone, failed to capture the screen details clearly enough for accurate video analysis or completely removed the users hands form the image. The task was problem was simple to state but more complicated to solve: design a camera rig that allows a user to hold their phone naturally, without interruption from the test moderator, and that captures both the screen and the user’s hand motions clearly. </p>

                    <p>With a physical, three dimensional product, sketching in 2d only goes so far. After looking at existing solutions to this problem, doing some research into other camera mount designs, including crane and stedi-cam systems used in Hollywood, I began experimenting with different rig designs. Keeping in mind that the rig would most likely be in motion of some kind throughout recording, I knew the final design would have to compensate for that. Additionally the materials used couldn’t be too expensive, as the budget for the final prototype was relatively small and needed to include an HD camera. The first few prototypes effectively used the flex happening in the platform materials to counteract the shake of the camera, as the whole unit flexed it did so in a way that made kept the shot steady on the screen of the phone, as if it wasn’t moving at all. While the central problem was solved a new problem was discovered, the weight and balance of the rig were critical to natural use, and the weight of a modern smartphone was not enough to balance the materials used for the camera arm. Additionally, the use of an off the shelf 720p webcam created the problem of having the focus locked farther away from the lens of the camera, which meant the camera had to be positioned farther away from the screen to keep it in focus, but increasing the length of the arm increased the weight and balance problems…</p>

                <p>New materials and a redesign of the neck, to one that was only flexible in the upper half, created a solution that was light and balanced enough to use comfortably as well as shake resistant enough to produce a crisp picture. Through the process the design of multiple platforms to allow for landscape and portrait orientation applications were also explored. The prototype pictured at left is the final prototype I delivered to Psychster. Since that time, the design has been tweaked both by myself and the team at Psychster. The tweaks include: different platform shapes and materials, different materials for the flexible neck and different sizes to accommodate tablets as well as smartphone sized devices.</p>

                    <p>In November 2011 Dr. Evans and I presented the camera rig solution as a poster at Microsoft’s World Usability Day conference. In the time since that presentation, it has become clear through an investigation of the marketplace that this product is simply too niche to mass produce profitably. There just isn’t a lot of demand for a camera mount to record the screen and hand movements of a mobile device outside the realm of research. Because of this realization, and because I believe having these tools will positively impact the testing and improvement of mobile devices and software in the future, I’m releasing the design into the public. A detailed build guide will be released and linked to here shortly. If you would like to view the poster presented at World Usability Day, you can <a href="http://www.notjustprettypictures.com/mobileUsabilityCameraRigPoster.pdf">download it as a full sized PDF</a>. I continue to work and improve this idea in my spare time, and will post any significant updates here as they happen. If you would like to discuss the design in more detail or have questions about the build guide, please feel free to contact me.</p>
