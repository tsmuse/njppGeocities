                    <p>Halo Waypoint is an online portal for gamers into the Halo Universe. It currently exists as an Xbox 360 console application, website and a Windows Phone 7 application. In my time at 343 Studios working on Halo Waypoint, I was lucky enough to work on all three screens of the Waypoint experience contributing most heavily to the web and console releases that happened while I was there. In addition to working on the launch of Halo Waypoint on the web and Windows Phone 7, I also worked on the underlying Content Management System (CMS) that powered all three screens, to make it more efficient and enjoyable for the content creators working full time on Waypoint.</p>

<p>The CMS redesign project became the primary project I worked on, as the redesign of the console application was pushed back by the redesign of the halowaypoint.com website and the Windows Phone 7 application. While I assisted the teams working on both of these applications, in both interaction and graphic design capacities, I was the only designer working on the CMS project. I lead research sessions with the content team that included interview sessions and observational studies to uncover the main pain-points in the system, and used this information to design solutions to them. The research results and proposed designs were submitted to the 343 Studio management shortly before my contract ended.</p>
