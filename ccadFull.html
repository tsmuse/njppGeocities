                <h4>The Project: Usability evaluation and new design</h4>
                <p>The Columbus College of Art & Design is a small, private fine arts college in Columbus OH, with a student body of aprox 1500. The school’s website was in need of a major overhaul, as it was hard to use and hard to maintain.</p>
                <h4>The Audience:</h4>
                <p>The site had 4 primary audiences: current students, perspective students, parents and alumni, as well as 2 secondary audiences: educators and staff. There was very little overlap in these audiences, except for parents who would likely want to see the information also presented to perspective students.</p>
                <h4>The Story:</h4>
                <p>When the Columbus College of Art and Design website project came to my team, it was a usability nightmare. We regularly received emails from parents, students, and alumni (sometimes as many as 10–15 a week) complaining about the lack of functionality. 10–15 a week may seem like a small number, but at a school with a total student population of 1500 students, it’s significant. When I did my initial heuristic evaluation of the UI, there were three main problems I knew we’d have to solve to improve the experience for our users.</p>

                    <h4>Giant Menus</h4>
                    <p>Each section of the existing site was represented by a drop down menu in the menu bar at the top of the page. These sections were part audience (students, parents, alumni) and part college department (campus services, admissions) and each menu dropped down below the fold of the page, so the bottom menu items were not usable in anyway.</p>
                    <h4>"Drop-down of Death"</h4>
                    <p>As a “work around” to the the gigantic menus in the menu bar, a drop–down menu titled “quicklinks” was added to each page. Like the menus, the contents of the “quicklinks” was longer than one screen, although because of the way the drop down form component was rendered, the user could scroll through the 2.5 pages of options.</p>
                    <h4>Very long, dense pages</h4>
                    <p>The site was very dense, and in an attempt to keep the number of pages the web team needed to maintain to a minimum, a lot of information was crammed into single pages. This lead to pages that were 8000px tall in some instances. Keep in mind the target display size was 1000px x 720px, so some of these pages were 11 screens tall! It was very difficult for users to navigate these giant pages, mostly because they were not well organized in addition to being really, really long.</p>

                <div class="span8">
                <p>As the rest of the design team began working in the visual design options for the new site, I focused on building a framework that would make the site easier and more enjoyable to use. Primarily this meant reorganizing it in a consistent, more hierarchical way and removing the giant, screen defying menus.</p>
                   <h4> Step 1 — Reorganization</h4>
                    <p>After looking at all the information on the site and talking to the various stake holders, it was decided to organize the site by audience. (This was a significant achievement as the usual org-chart navigation was the preference of a lot of stakeholders.)  The top menu in the new design would become a menu dedicated to switching between audience specific sections of the site. The Audiences decided upon for the final menu were: Future Students, Current Students, Alumni, Employees, and Educators.</p>
                    <p>After talking to various members of our original audiences, it was discovered that the parents of the future students weren’t really looking at the parents section of the site, they were looking at the future students section. With this information we decided to combine the two sections into “Future Students.”</p>
                    <p>The last three audiences: Alumni, Employees and Educators were secondary audiences, but the stake- holders were adamant they appear in the top menu. With the consolidation of the top menu, we had room to add them and could make them a more easily accessible part of the site.</p>
                    <p>In addition to reorganizing the top menu bar, each page was analyzed and broken out into easily digestible pieces tied together with a section page. So, for example, instead of having one gigantic page for Student Services, a Student Services section page was created with smaller sub-pages for: Financial Aid, Bursar, Registration and Records, etc. As adding a content management system was deemed too expensive a change to make in this redesign, compartmentalizing the pages into smaller, logical groups made maintenance easier than having to manage the larger pages of the old site, even though there were more files.</p>
                    <h4>Step 2 — A new kind of menu</h4>
                    <p>After multiple meetings with stake holders trying to reduce the number of menu options on the site, it became clear that there was just no way to remove many of them without negatively impacting one group or another. This was a problem we needed to design a solution for.</p>
                    <p>The 2–column “Smart–menu” was the solution I arrived at, a menu that could show a variety of options in a smaller amount of space. The idea was fairly straight forward. In the left column, all the options for a specific audience were displayed, with the top option selected by default. In the right column, a sub–menu with all the options for the topic selected in the left column. This allowed a large number of menu items to be displayed in a menu that was no taller than the screen. This meant no menus bleeding off the bottom of the viewable area, and no more drop–down you have to scroll through. This also meant that the menu could be customized to the audience selected from the top menu, leading to less confusion about where relevant information was, because the only information displayed was what was for that audience. For example, Alumni were not presented with the options for Financial Aid or the Bursar, but were presented with Registration and Records.</p>

                    <p>While my time at CCAD Design Group ended before this site design could be fully implemented (it was built and deployed approximately 4 months after my departure) testing of prototypes showed, across all audiences, considerably faster access to the information users were looking for and much less frustration from not being able to find something or from running into something that appeared broken (such as a menu that dropped down below the fold).</p>
                    <p>In addition to the end–users tested, the members of the web team, in charge of maintaining the site, found the new page structure and organization of files into groups of section pages and their children much easier to maintain in user testing. We anticipated this change alone would cut the time spent making updates to pages by as much as 25%, and would almost eliminate rework due to other errors introduced into the larger old files while updating. (Note: that I was no longer there when the site was live, so these figures are only estimates based on the limited user testing performed during the design of the site.)</p>
